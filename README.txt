A pokemon-esque fight simulator. It simulates a player fighting against another player using a “cute creature” surrogate. The app tracks the health, defense, attack damage, experience, experience worth, and current level of every player's creature. There is also an evolve feature. It is not playable; it is more like a test to display how the game would work. 

It shouldn't be too difficult to make it playable, so I plan to update the code soon and add some kind of playable demo. I also plan to implement it in either Unity or Unreal in the future, translating the java over to C# or C++ (or refactoring it all-together to work better in those environments).
